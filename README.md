# Bevy Jam5 Tree
This is my entry for bevy jam5 "cycles". It simulates the life cycle of trees/a forest.
The game has some user action that certainly change the way the game plays out, but there is no real strategy with the implemented mechanics.
Assets are not really finished, but considering I did them myself the end result would probably not be much better :D.
